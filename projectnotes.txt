Blind Center Meet 04/03/25 & 04/04/25
Belt Sucks
    Belt is a little jumbled
    Some letters too close together and some too far apart
    D & H switched
    Belt not proportional
Wheel is Good
    Great size and spacing
    Definitely the winner idea
Braille Machines IRL
    Center for the blind has a few braille embossers
    Take text from a file or thumb drive, then
    emboss the braille onto paper like a printer
    Braille embossers have numbers and contractions
    Numbers are just the number sign (backwards L) then a character (A-J)
    Needs at least 20ish characters
