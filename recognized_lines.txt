Preparing PDFS for Insight
Instructions for Mac oS and Windows
Overview: What Is an Insight PDF?
01
PDF documents serve as the source material for Insight, Random House, Inc.'s online book content
search and browsing service.
An Insight PDF is composed of a high-resolution cover and a complete, cropped book interior. The
PDF should contain bookmarks created in Adobe Acrobat that target particular sections of the work.
These bookmarks will later be converted into XML information that lets Random House, Inc. and its
partners control which sections of the book are available through the Insight Program.
In order to simplify the Insight process for our partners, the Content Management Group has
prepared a set of standards for PDF creation. Please follow these standards as closely as possible
before submitting material to Insight.
